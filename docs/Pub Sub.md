<summary>What means to say that Pub/Sub is a good solution to buffer changes for lightly coupled architectures</summary>
It means that it is an effective approach for handling communication and data synchronization between different components or services in a system that are loosely interconnected.

In a lightly coupled architecture, the components or services are designed to be independent and have minimal direct dependencies on each other. They communicate through well-defined interfaces or messages, allowing them to evolve and scale independently. This design approach promotes flexibility and easier maintenance of the system.
